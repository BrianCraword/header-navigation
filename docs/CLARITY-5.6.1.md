# Navigation clarity validation — 5.6.1

Approved Phase1: readable AI actions and clearer personal destinations in You. No native menu retirement, unread logic, server permissions, redirects, or deployment changes.

Validation: 64 Node tests passed (49 navigation,15 AI), independently rerun. Both components compiled with Canvas in isolated Discourse2026.9.0-latest. Upgrade preserved31 stored navigation settings; rollback boolean persisted. Normal-member local browser checks covered You destinations/close/back/reload and AI start/thread at320/390px, plus desktop760/1100/1440. AI draft blocked New and retained text; clearing the synthetic draft allowed New to return to start. No AI requests sent. Independent source/screenshot review found no substantive Phase1 blocker.

Limits: physical-phone keyboard, dark-mode visual review, installed production stack and functioning persistent-memory backend remain unverified. Local memory panel showed its unavailable state; close/focus still checked. Source review does not imply broader navigation or unread parity.

Rollout: update the existing component from main, then verify installed normal-member mobile journeys. Brian owns deployment. Navigation clarity can be disabled with je_nav_identity_clarity_enabled; this restores configured You rows without rewriting saved settings. Full prior baselines: header-navigation a4612f5 (5.6.0), AI616ff98 (1.4.1). Use a follow-up revert for full rollback; preserve settings.
